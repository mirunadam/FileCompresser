# HUFFMAN FileCompresser
My project implements in C++ both Static (compression based on precomputed symbol frequencies, with the trie written to the output file) and Adaptive(compression that updates dynamically as data is read, with the option of not knowing even the filesize) Huffman Algorithm, alongside a helper bit_proccesing for compact file writing.
